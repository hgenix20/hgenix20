# Hey there, I'm Kameron Green! 👋

I'm a hands-on developer with a passion for automation and AI, blending over 8 years of professional experience into crafting innovative, real-world solutions. Whether it's building robust RPA systems, designing seamless API integrations, or experimenting with multi-agent architectures, I love the challenge of turning complex problems into fun, automated workflows.

## What I'm Up To 🚀
Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in cutting-edge AI research as I work through my Masters in Computer Science. When I'm not coding or brainstorming the next big automation project, you'll find me exploring new tech trends and testing out creative solutions to make systems more efficient and secure.

## Let’s Collaborate and Create Awesome Stuff! 🤝
I’m always on the lookout for cool projects and collaborations that push the boundaries of what's possible with automation and AI. If you’re building something innovative or need a fresh perspective on streamlining tech processes, I’d love to team up and make the magic happen.

**P.S.** Fun fact: I once built a multi-agent system from scratch that boosted decision accuracy by 30% and cut errors by 80% in just a few months – now that's what I call a win! 😄
